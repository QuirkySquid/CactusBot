## Python Formatting

TL;DR: stick to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and you should be fine.

> ### Keep it Clean
>   We don't want any profanity or anything offensive in our code. We get it, coding can be frustrating and some people don't mind using strong language. In this case, however, please refrain.
>
> ### Indentation
>   PEP8 states that spaces are the preferred indentation method.
>
>   We use four-space indentation. Because Python requires consistent indentation, please do the same.
>
> ### Maximum Line Length
>   PEP8 puts the maximum line length at 79 characters. Please follow this guideline; it makes code much more readable.
>
> ### Encoding
>   File encoding must be UTF-8. Shouldn't be too much of an issue, as most computers support it, but it is required. (If you don't know what UTF-8 is, you're probably already using it.)
>
> ### Quotes
>   We use double quotes for text, and single quotes for symbols and characters.
>
> ### Everything Else
>   [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)!
